/* step18: Tailwind has three layers:

base → for global resets & base styles (like HTML tags).
components → for reusable classes/components.
utilities → for atomic utility classes (like bg-red-500).

The following apply-directive is Tailwind’s way of creating your own reusable CSS class inside the Tailwind.
